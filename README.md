# SkillNestIT
SkillNestIT is the final project in the enigmacamp bootcamp which is done by a team.
This project aims to build a portfolio and hone skills where job seekers can work on imitation tasks given by companies.
And companies can also see the tasks that have been completed and give them feedback.
